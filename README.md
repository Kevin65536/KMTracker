# ActivityTrack

A privacy-focused, lightweight input tracking tool for Windows. Inspired by WhatPulse, ActivityTrack allows you to monitor your keyboard and mouse usage, visualize heatmaps, and track application-specific statistics locally on your machine.

## Key Highlights

✨ **6 Comprehensive Tabs** - Dashboard, Heatmap, Applications, History, Screen Time, and Settings  
🎨 **5 Heatmap Themes** - Classic, Fire, Ocean, Purple, and Matrix color schemes  
📊 **Advanced Analytics** - Timeline and Insights charts with weekday/hourly patterns  
⏱️ **Screen Time Tracking** - Monitor foreground application usage time  
🎯 **Per-App Filtering** - Filter heatmaps and statistics by specific applications  
🔒 **100% Private** - All data stored locally, no cloud sync or telemetry

### 🔒 Privacy First
- All data is stored locally in a SQLite database (`tracker.db`)
- No keylogging - only frequency counting of keys
- No data is ever sent to the cloud or external servers
- Full control over data retention

## Releases

Pre-compiled Windows executables are available in the [Releases](https://github.com/Kevin65536/ActivityTrack/releases) section.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 (64-bit recommended)
- Python 3.10+

### Dependencies
- `PySide6` (UI Framework)
- `pywin32` (Windows API hooks)
- `psutil` (Process information for app tracking)
- `numpy` (Heatmap data processing)
- `scipy` (Heatmap smoothing)
- `matplotlib` (History charts)

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository or download the source code.
2.  Open a terminal in the `ActivityTrack` directory.
3.  Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```powershell
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
4.  Install dependencies:
    ```powershell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1.  Run the main application script:
    ```powershell
    python main.py
    ```
    *Note: To track input in high-privilege applications (e.g., Task Manager, Admin prompts), you may need to run the terminal/script as Administrator.*

2.  The application will start, and a system tray icon will appear.
3.  Use the different tabs to view your statistics:
    - **Dashboard**: Quick overview with time range selection (Today/Week/Month/Year/All Time)
    - **Heatmap**: Keyboard and Mouse heatmaps with per-app filtering and theme customization
    - **Applications**: Detailed per-app statistics (table and pie chart views)
    - **History**: Timeline and Insights charts showing usage trends and patterns
    - **Screen Time**: Application foreground time tracking with distribution charts
    - **Settings**: Customize startup behavior, data retention, and heatmap themes

## Privacy Note

This tool uses low-level system hooks (`SetWindowsHookEx`) to count keystrokes and mouse events. 

**What we track:**
- Frequency of key presses (e.g., "Spacebar pressed 50 times")
- Mouse click counts and positions (for heatmap visualization)
- Mouse movement distance (calculated from pixel distance and physical screen size)
- Scroll wheel usage count
- Active foreground application names and usage time

**What we DON'T track:**
- Actual text or passwords you type (no keylogging)
- Clipboard content
- Screenshot or window content
- Network activity

All data is stored locally in `tracker.db` in the application directory. You have full control over data retention through the Settings page.
